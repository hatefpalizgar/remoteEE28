## Interview Questions

**What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?**
There are several differences between `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` in Java:

1.  Implementation: `LinkedList` is implemented using a linked list data structure, while `ArrayList` is implemented using an array-based data structure. This means that `LinkedList` uses nodes that store references to the next and previous elements in the list, while `ArrayList` uses an array to store its elements.

2.  Performance: As a result of their different implementations, `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` have different performance characteristics in certain situations. `ArrayList` is generally faster than `LinkedList` when it comes to accessing elements at a specific index, but `LinkedList` is faster at inserting and deleting elements in the middle of the list.

3.  Memory usage: `LinkedList` typically requires more memory than `ArrayList` because it stores references to both the next and previous elements in addition to the element itself. `ArrayList` only stores the elements themselves, so it uses less memory.

4.  Additional methods: `LinkedList` has additional methods for manipulating the list, such as `addFirst` and `addLast`, which allow you to insert elements at the beginning or end of the list. `ArrayList` does not have these methods, but it does have other methods such as `add(int index, E element)` and `set(int index, E element)` that allow you to insert or modify elements at a specific index.


Overall, the choice between using a `LinkedList` or an `ArrayList` will depend on your specific needs and the characteristics of your data. If you need fast random access to elements and don't need to frequently insert or delete elements in the middle of the list, `ArrayList` may be a good choice. On the other hand, if you need to frequently insert or delete elements in the middle of the list and don't need fast random access, `LinkedList` may be a better choice.

**How to sort an ArrayList of objects using custom comparator?**  
To sort an `ArrayList` of objects using a custom comparator in Java, you can use the `Collections.sort` method along with a comparator that defines the sort order.

Here is an example of how to sort an `ArrayList` of `Person` objects by their last name:

    import java.util.ArrayList;
	import java.util.Collections;
	import java.util.Comparator;

	public class Main {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
	        ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
	        people.add(new Person("John", "Doe"));
	        people.add(new Person("Jane", "Doe"));
	        people.add(new Person("Bob", "Smith"));

        // Sort the list using a custom comparator
        Collections.sort(people, new Comparator<Person>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                // Compare the last names
                return p1.getLastName().compareTo(p2.getLastName());
            }
        });

        // Print the sorted list
        for (Person person : people) {
            System.out.println(person);
        }
    }
	}

	class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    public Person(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
    }
	}

The output of this code will be:

	Jane Doe
	John Doe
	Bob Smith

Note that the `Collections.sort` method expects a `List` as its first argument, so you can use it to sort any `List` implementation, not just `ArrayList`.

**How to synchronize concurrent modifications to an ArrayList? (Collections.synchronizedList() and CopyOnWriteArrayList)**

To synchronize concurrent modifications to an `ArrayList` in Java, you can use the `synchronizedList` method from the `Collections` class to wrap the `ArrayList` in a thread-safe list implementation.

Here is an example of how to use the `synchronizedList` method to synchronize concurrent modifications to an `ArrayList`:

	import java.util.ArrayList;
	import java.util.Collections;
	import java.util.List;

	public class Main {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
	        List<String> list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());

        // Add some elements to the list
        list.add("element1");
        list.add("element2");
        list.add("element3");

        // Synchronize access to the list using the synchronized block
        synchronized (list) {
            for (String element : list) {
                System.out.println(element);
            }
        }
	   }
	}

The `synchronizedList` method returns a thread-safe version of the `ArrayList` that can be used to synchronize access to the list. When accessing the list, you should wrap the code in a `synchronized` block and use the returned list object as the lock. This ensures that only one thread can modify the list at a time, preventing concurrent modification exceptions.

Alternatively, you can use the `CopyOnWriteArrayList` class from the `java.util.concurrent` package, which is a thread-safe implementation of a list that uses copy-on-write semantics. This means that the list is not locked when reading from it, but a new copy of the list is created and written to when modifying it, which can improve concurrency in some situations.
