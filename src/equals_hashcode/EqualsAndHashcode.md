In Java, the `equals` method is a method that is defined in the `Object` class and is used to
determine if two objects are equal.
It is defined as follows:

    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return (this == obj);
    }

This method compares the object on which it is called (`this`) to the object passed as a
parameter (`obj`) and returns `true` if they are the same object, and `false` if they are not.

However, this default implementation is often not sufficient for our needs, and we need to override
the `equals` method in our own classes to define what it means for two objects to be equal.
For example, we may want two instances of a `Person` class to be considered equal if they have the
same name and age, regardless of whether they are the same object.
In this case, we would override the `equals` method as follows:

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == this) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Person)) return false;
        Person p = (Person) o;
        return p.name.equals(name) && p.age == age;
    }

The `hashCode` method is a method that is also defined in the `Object` class and is used to generate
a numerical value that represents an object.
This value, known as a "hash code," is used in various data structures and algorithms to identify
and locate objects.

The default implementation of `hashCode` in the `Object` class simply returns the memory address of
the object, but this is often not sufficient for our needs.
In order to override the `hashCode` method, we need to ensure that two objects that are considered
equal by the `equals` method have the same hash code.
For example, if we override the `equals` method in our `Person` class as shown above, we would also
override the `hashCode` method as follows:

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = 17;
        result = 31 * result + name.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + age;
        return result;
    }

This implementation generates a hash code for a `Person` object based on the hash code of the
person's name and the person's age.

It's important to note that the `hashCode` method should be implemented consistently with
the `equals` method.
This means that if two objects are considered equal by the `equals` method, they should have the
same hash code.
Similarly, if two objects have the same hash code, they should be considered equal by the `equals`
method.
